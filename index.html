                <p>This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system.
                    It
                    helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the
                    tutorial
                    can be read off-line as well.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        something you need to know. This Documentation Page doesn't require any programming experiece or programming background
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This little tutorial assumes you are a total begginer
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but
                effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its
                interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most
                platforms.</p>
                <p>The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.</p>

                <p>Few requirements are needed before we start<p>

                </ul>
                <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major
                platforms from the Python web site, <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a>, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains
                distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.</p>
                <p>This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature.
                Instead, it introduces many of Python’s most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language’s flavor
                and style.</p>

                <p>Python is an interpreted high-level programming language with dynamic semantics and object-oriented programming designed
                to be easy to read and implement. It is a scripting language like Perl/ruby and used for creating web applications too.
                </p>
                <p>Java-Script is an object-oriented programming language that allows you to create dynamic web pages and got standardized
                in ECMAScript language specification. Java-Script supports different programming paradigm as object-oriented,
                functional, and imperative programming but not procedural programming.</p>

                </header>
                <!-- Falar sobre a maldião do hello world -->
                <p>The hello world program is the most important program you ever write and this goes to any programming language or technology. The Hello World curse says that if your first program on your new programming language is not Hello World you're are going to be cursed by not beig able to learn or having a lot of difficulty picking it up. If it's real or not, let's just make sure we get a good start at the language ;)</p>
                <code>print("Hello World")</code>
                <!-- Explicar oque cada coisa faz -->
                <p>This is how you do your first hello world in Python. Congratulations! You're not cursed forever. Let's explain everything in this line because a lot is happening.</p>
                <p>First, everything in Python is a object, this tutorial will not get into Objects and and OOP but just keep this in mind for the future. First the print functional <code>print()</code> is called and takes the parameter in this case <code>"Hello World"</code> That is a string of Characters and printing into the console. May seem simple but alot is happening under the hood</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
                <header>
                    <h1>Variables</h1>
                </header>
                <p>Variables can be think as a parking lot. you can store data in variables, or Park cars in the parking lot. Variables are a crucial part in programming and one of the most important things you have to learn. Look at the below example:</p>
                <code>x = 10</code> <br>
                <code>y = 20</code> <br>
                <code>z = x + y</code> <br>
                <code>print(z)</code> <br>
                <code>output: 30</code>
                <p>x recieves the value of 10 so if we would <code>print(x)</code> The console would print 10. Variables hold information and assign to a name like x or any name you want. You can also see that we can do math with the variables values and assign the result of that variable addition to another variable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In python you can store all of the <a href="#Data_Types">Data Types</a> in a variable <br>
                    <code>my_name = "Your name here"</code><br>
                    <code>my_number = 10</code> <br>
                    <code>thuthy = True</code> <br>
                    <code>my_gpa = 2.9</code> <br>
                    <code>my_list = [10, 12, 14]</code>
                </p>

                <!-- Explicar como matematica funciona em python e floats e ints -->
                <p>There's 2 types of numbers. Integers numbers, and floats numbers. In Python, integers are zero, positive or negative whole numbers without a fractional part and having unlimited
                precision, e.g. 0, 100, -10. The followings are valid integer literals in Python.</p>
                <p><code>12 + 12.5</code> <br>
                <code>>>>24.5</code><br>
                <code>12 + 12</code><br>
                <code>>>>24</code>

                <!-- aprodundar nos floats e ints e falar de strings booleans e outros -->
                <p>The main data types that you will use the most are <code>Strings int float bool List Tuple Dictionary Sets</code></p>
                <h4>Strings</h4>
                <p><code>strings</code> or <code>str</code> Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.</p>
                <h4>ints</h4>
                <p>Ints as said before are a integer number. such  <br>
                <code>0 <br> 1 <br> 100</code></p>
                <h4>Floats</h3>
                <p>Floats are the floating numbers, they are decimal numbers examples:</p>
                <code>12.9 <br> 1.0 <br> 0.72727</code>
                <h4>Bools</h4>
                <p>bools or booleans values are pretty simple, They represent True or False, 0 or 1 some examples that evaluate to true:</p>
                <code>True <br> False <br> ""</code> <br> The empty string evaluate to <code>False</code> at the other side a string with one space <code>" "</code> evaluates to True
                <code></code>

                <!-- falar sobre if and else e elif -->
                <p>The control flow programns are a pretty simple but important to any programming language. <code>if else elif</code> are the keywords that you will be using look at the example below</p>
                <!-- exemplo -->
                <code>
                    my_boolean = True <br>
                    if my_boolean == True: <br>
                    <p>....    print("Hello World")</p>
                    else: print("Bye world") <br>
                    output: >>> Hello World
                    
                    
                </code>
                <!-- explicar o elif melhor -->
                <p>the variable evaluates to the boolean True, so it reads like english, if the variable is equal to true print hello world to the console.</p>

                <p><code>range(100)</code> is an iterable, a list of numbers with 10 numbers, sarting from 0 till 9, the for loop gives us the ablity to create the variable x and keep track of the iterated data inm this example, it's like x is = 0 at the first interation and it gets printed, the next interation is x = 1 it and it prints out 1 and so on and so on till the iterable end. </p>
